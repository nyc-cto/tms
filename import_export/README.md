# Import/Export Files

## Overview

This folder includes the code for importing data from and exporting data to various external data sources where original documents and translated content is hosted. Currently, Google documents and Wordpress sites are the two data sources integrated into the ELSA continuous localization pipeline.

## Google Docs

To properly import/export Google docs with Serge, you need to set up the following:

1. A Gmail account
2. OAuth redentials allowing you to access the Google Drive/Docs API via your Gmail account. To set up these credentials:
	a. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
	b. Create a project, if you have not already
	c. Go to `Create Credentials --> OAuth client ID` (TODO: What Application Type should you choose?)
	d. Create the credentials, download then, and save 2 copies, one as `credentials_drive.json` and another as `credentials_docs.json`, in a credentials folder called `secrets` in the root level of the git project. 
3. A Google drive folder which will contain all of the original and translated documents in folders. The original documents lie in the `en` folder, and each language you are translating into will have documents in ISO 639-1 standard language code-named folders. For example, if in your Google Drive you create a root folder named `Translations` and want to translate into Spanish (es) and Mandarin (zh), the directory structure would be as follows:

```
Translations
|
|____en
|
|____es
|
|____zh
```

The original documents would placed in the `en` folder under the `Translations` subfolder, and the Spanish/Mandarin translations of those documents will go into the `es` and `zh` folders, respectively.

Since Google's API refers to folders and files by their ID, we need to map the names of the language folders to their respective folder IDs. The folder ID can be found by going to the folder, where the URL will look like https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/<folder ID>. The folder ID can be copied from that part of the URL and will be around 25 characters. The mapping should be put in a new file called `drive_config.yaml` and will look like the following:

```
language_folders:
  en:
    abc123
  es:
    def456  
```

Where abc123 and def456 are the folder IDs for the en and es folders, respectively (example strings in this case).

### Example

Make sure that the service is running somewhere (for example, in Docker, as detailed in [these setup instructions](../docs/getting-started.md))

Now that you have the Google Drive folder structure for translations, let's try running one.

In your Translations/en folder, create a new doc called "translation1".

In the doc, add this text:

```
Hello, world!
```

Next, head to your command line on your local workstation and enter your running Docker container (if you are using Docker to run the service):

```bash
(your-local-workstation) $ docker-compose exec serge bash
```

Once you are in the container, change to this directory:

```bash
(docker-container) $ cd /var/tms
```

And run this command:

```bash
(docker-container) $ sh run_ingest_sync_simple.sh
```

## Wordpress

### Importing from Wordpress

When a wordpress website changes, import-wordpress.py will download the new contents of the site via wordpress’s built-in JSON REST API at the endpoint `wp-json/wp/v2/posts`. It needs you to set the site’s login credentials WP_IMPORT_URL, WP_IMPORT_USER, and WP_IMPORT_PASSWORD in the .env file. Then you can run the script via `python import-wordpress.py`

To activate it, import-wordpress needs to be notified each time the website changes. It runs a flask server which listens on port 5000 (the default flask port) for requests to the /wp-updates endpoint. If you are testing it locally, you may find it easiest to trigger the webhook manually by just loading http://localhost:5000/wp-updates in your browser.

#### Using WP Webhooks to Listen for Changes

When deployed to production, we suggest you use a wordpress plugin to automatically trigger the flask endpoint when the site is changed. We used WP Webhooks. Once this plugin is installed, on the wp-admin page, go to Settings->WP Webhooks. To make debugging easier, you may temporarily turn off the global setting "Deactivate Post Trigger Delay". 

Go to Send Data->Send Data on Post Update.  Add a new webhook. 

Webhook Name = Your name or something

Webhook Url = http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.FLASK:5000/wp-updates

Set  "allow unsafe looking urls". 

Click orange "Add" button

Click "Send Demo". This should cause it to ping your flask endpoint.

From the main menu on the left hand side of the page, go to Posts -> All Posts and click "Edit" under "Hello World".
Make a change to the text of the page and click "Update".
This should cause it to ping your flask endpoint.
